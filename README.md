A Trie structure for big dictionaries.

---

## Goal

Need to store a million keys in a dictionary? Running out of memory doing just that? Use a tree! Oh, and attach any metadata!

## Installation

Node `>=8.9.0` is required.

```bash
npm install --save meta-trie
```

To perform tests use:

```bash
cd node_modules/meta-trie
npm i
npm t
```

This project also has a benchmark that you can run yourself:

```bash
cd node_modules/meta-trie
npm i
npm run benchmark
```

## Usage

Documentation is available [here](https://walasek.github.io/node-meta-trie/).

```javascript
const TrieNode = require('meta-trie');

const my_tree = new TrieNode();
// Store anything, the key should be a string (can be a number, but that's hacky)
my_tree.put('some key', 'some value');

// Can retrieve it too
if(my_tree.get('some key') != 'some value')
	throw `This won't ever happen, no worries`;

// Can iterate over the whole tree
for([key, value] of my_tree)
	console.log(`${key} => ${value}`);
```

For simplicity there is also a simple Proxy that supports a dictionary-like interface. Beware that this has a performance hit.

```javascript
const trieDict = require('meta-trie/dict');

const my_tree = trieDict();
// Store stuff like in a dictionary
my_tree['some key'] = 'some value';

// Grab it too
if(my_tree['some key'] != 'some value')
	throw `Not a chance`;

// JSONize it, note there's no way to parse it back into a tree
console.log(JSON.stringify(my_tree));
// {"some key": "some value"}

// Iteration of the dict Proxy currently not implemented.
```

# Benchmarks

The following benchmark compares two different keying strategies - Wide tree tests a lot of short keys (each tree node has many children), while Deep tree tests longer keys with more randomness in them (also requires more memory/can store less data). Beware that key generation for Deep tree takes a lot more time.

```

It is crucial for high performance computing to properly pick a keying strategy for your use case. Keep in mind this library only helps with keys, it won't help you store 10 gigs of values (but will work just fine as an index).
